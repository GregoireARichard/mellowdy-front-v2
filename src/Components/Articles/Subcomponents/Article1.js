          <h1>What is Mellowdy ?</h1>
          <p> Mellowdy is an optimized playlist creator, made using Spotify’s
              API. We have worked on it for months now,
              and are proud to release it to the public!<br/>
              We thought we’d introduce everyone to the design thinking
              of our website, and give an overall tour.
              First off, the homepage which is covered by a fun,
              interactive 3D background made up of little music notes
              and hearts. We truly wanted the user to feel at home in 
              a very simple environment which still leaves a bit of room 
              for creative freedom. Our call to action button pressed, 
              you’re taken to a quick login page, and bam! Right in the 
              creation process. Really easy right? <br/>We hate websites 
              which take a lot of talking and discovering to get to the 
              point, so we strayed as far as that model as possible. 
              Our playlist creator has virtually every setting you could 
              think of, and I won’t be citing it’s numerous parameters here 
              as it’s just so exciting to figure them out by yourself! 
              <br/><br/>We can’t wait to see what fun playlists you come up with ❤️
