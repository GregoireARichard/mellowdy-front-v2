          <p>
            We'd like to underline that we are pretty proud of our website and 
            idea. Personally, playlists are hard for me to make and just 
            end up being a bunch of songs that you listen to on random, 
            but thanks to Mellowdy (shameless plug, I know, but I 
            swear I'm being truhful haha!), there's a neat order and 
            everything.<br/> The original plan was to use it with the help 
            of moods, simply according to your mood (feeling happy, sexy, 
            sadâ€¦..), you'd click on an icon, modify some parameters and bam!! 
            Free playlist! As you can guess, we strayed quite a bit from that 
            original idea. <br/>However, today with our active users are in the 
            40's, and we look forward to continuing to improve our
            services so that the site grows more and more, it's really 
            exciting. Looks like we made the right choice after
            all. And thank you also for coming from 4 different 
            countries! That's insanely fun, we love to travel and meet
            people from all kinds of places so we're so proud of our 
            mixed audience.<br/><br/>So go! Go make playlists to set the desired 
            mood - for instance, make playlists for fun, acting or chase
            scenes, or scenes where a huge story is revealed 
            (if you're on booktok, ikyk...). Pick a composer and use us to 
            discover more songs a radio station ever could find ðŸ¥³
