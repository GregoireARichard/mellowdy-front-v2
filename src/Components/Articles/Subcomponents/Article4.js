          <h1>What knowledges Mellowdy brought us (Part 1)</h1>
          <p>
          The things we learned while making Mellowdy and 
          developing our own project as students:<br/><br/>
          From a purely business POV: When it comes to social 
          media marketing, ou don't have to write a book or say 
          something profound, you just have to engage and interact. 
          That is what it means to be successful nowadays. Always be 
          authentic to yourself and / or the people you talk about or 
          answer to. We all know what a spam comment looks like. And if 
          you really want to connect, send a DM to the creator. Mention 
          the post and why you liked it. Respond to their story and say 
          something valuable. Ask if you can help, collaborate, promote, 
          etc. It genuinely helped our brand grow a bunch, and we couldn't 
          be happier about making the decisions we made. ðŸ¤©
