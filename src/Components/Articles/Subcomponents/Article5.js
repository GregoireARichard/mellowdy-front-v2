          The things we learned while making Mellowdy and 
          developing our own project as students:<br/><br/>
          Now more of an introspection: Every day, people are on the 
          net making their own worlds, their own creative decisions in 
          terms of what types of content they prefer to eat up, and what 
          sources they decide to eat it from. They are forging their own 
          communities, which make and change the world on a regular basis. 
          To be efficient, campaigns today have to either be the creator of 
          these digital worlds, or penetrate the digital world produced by 
          a more powerful effort. We decided on the latter 
          (and hopefully you're able to recognize that, we love you guys ❤️ )
