          <h1>What knowledges Mellowdy brought us (Part 3)</h1>
          <p>
            This is kind of a heavy one. We like to think we represent 
            transparency. Delving into these digital mines and coming up 
            with jewels of good or bad and horrible. We took a good look 
            and imagined this world for what it was, crawling behind 
            boardroom doors, crowd sourcing salary content, 
            videoing acts of aggression and immorality and sharing them 
            in this country, the world. <br/>We shine lights at black corners, 
            finding out all those things that permit greed and immorality 
            and persecution to survive and fester and thrive. We ended 
            thinking that years of education is equivalent to merit, 
            we stopped buying into these sales pitches, yet things 
            thought to make us look like we were all winners. And we 
            just tried to make something out of it. Chose a lighthearted 
            design, connected with a company which seems to uphold 
            benevolent values (Spotify) and just made something that 
            started out as a tiny idea in our young minds.<br/> We didn't 
            think of the marketing value, nor the money, nor the 
            future ad plan. Nah, we decided to make something simple, 
            fun and attainable for everyone (pretty basic human 
            functions if you ask me, but sadly rarer and rarer). 
            From a few students out in Paris, we hope you really like our 
            project and take the time to share it with people you enjoy 
            connecting with. 'Cause connections are kind of all we have 
            left. ðŸ’ž
