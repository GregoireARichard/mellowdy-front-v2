          <h1>The Mellowdy's Mindset</h1>
          <p>
            We wished to share a bit of introspection with you today. 
            A mindset of sorts if you're feeling unmotivated.
            There is one lesson every creator needs to know: Plans 
            aren't real. Ideas aren't real. Desires aren't real.
            Actions are the only thing that exist in this world. <br/><br/>
            If you don't have anything to show for your work at the end
            of the day you did nothing. In your mind you might have 
            the greatest novel ever written, but if you haven't
            started writing it yet, it simply doesn't exist. 
            Whatever knowledge you gained thinking or reading about
            something is worthless if you don't apply it. 
            Don't be worthless. Do something. We mean it.
            Nobody knows what your plans are. Most people 
            won't care about what you know. Thoughts have no
            impact. So do something. Make your ideas 
            materialize in the world.
            We took that leap with Mellowdy, did it, took 
            the time, formed an idea and let it free to other 
            humans (you!!) to see.<br/><br/>
            We hope you get to experience the seeds of that 
            idea and as like we did, get inspired to create what
            you have buried deep in you! ðŸ’ª
