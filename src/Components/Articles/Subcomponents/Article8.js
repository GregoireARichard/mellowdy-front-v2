          <h1>About GrÃ©goire...</h1>
          <p>
            I had the idea of mellowdy from September 2021, 
            initially I wanted to create the site using ruby on rails, 
            the idea was going well but I didn't know how to use 
            the Spotify API yet. More importantly, I was completely 
            unaware of its huge potential.<br/><br/>
            The project was originally called synapps and it was 
            during the week we had a class called "Fullstack" that 
            the project was really born.
            We were given an assignment: make a web application 
            that had to use the API of some company - of our choice - 
            and have a concrete result. The stack was imposed, 
            we had to use Symfony in the back, React with Typescript 
            for the front and Axios to make the link between the two. 
            After 7 long days of intensive coding and a few liters of Coke, 
            the application was finally released. At first it didn't 
            look the same since there was no Three.js and we had to 
            redo the whole front end (well us, especially Louis) 
            since the library we were using to make the different elements
            of the form didn't work with Typescript.  
            Once all that was done, it was only a few weeks later 
            that I decided to take 4 euros from my wallet to buy the 
            domain name mellowdy.fr. <br/><br/>
            As far as I'm concerned - because I was originally 
            supposed to write about myself - I've been coding 
            since I was in second grade and I haven't been coding 
            like a child for only a year, and yes, it takes time to 
            change my practices.
            I've mastered (well, I've used two or three times, let's 
            calm down) some JS/PHP and Ruby frameworks, like Vue, Nuxt 
            and React, Symfony, Laravel and Rails.
            Oh and if you're passing by and know people in NYC, 
            I'm looking for a 6 month internship ðŸ™‚
