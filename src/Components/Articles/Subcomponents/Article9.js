          <p>Hey guys !<br/><br/>Well, not that much
          to add about how i worked on Mellowdy since
          Grégoire almost told you everything (kinda
          embarrassing for me 🤐) but as you might
          have understood, I’m the one who coded
          the whole interface of Mellowdy, from
          the first react component to the last
          css style 🤗<br/><br/>About myself,
          I’m 19 and I’m a Front-End developer
          since 2019 that would like to become
          a creative web developer, particularly in
           3D 
           web development with webGL using Three.js, 
           and other libraries such as GSAP or DAT. 
           About my stack, I mainly use Javascript 
           for coding, with different frameworks 
           like React.js or Vue.js.<br/><br/>By the 
           way, I’m looking for an internship as 
           Front-end dev, so if you know someone 
           who’s looking for an intern that master 
           Three.js around Paris you can contact me 
           here → <a href="mailto:louiscuenot@icloud.com">📧</a>
           </p>
